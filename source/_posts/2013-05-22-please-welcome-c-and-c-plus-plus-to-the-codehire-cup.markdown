## Registrations for the Codehire Cup have kicked off with a bang!

We’re getting a great response and some even greater feedback from our early contestants. One area that has gathered a bit of momentum is the competition languages. Especially in regards to some that have missed out.

Due to time constraints we won’t be able add every language under the sun, but we’ve seen a substantial push for C & C++ to be included. compared to other languages. For this reason we have decided to contestants two more options to choose from!

If you think that we should include a specific language in the next Codehire Cup, let us know the language and pitch to us why it should be included in the comments below!
