### The competition is reaching the final stages, the top 100 contestants have prevailed through the online preliminary and semifinal rounds and the finale is just over a week away.

To give the final contestants a heads up we’ve put together a schedule of how the finale will play out.

For those competing in the finale remotely you’ll need to pay special attention to the challenge time. Unlike previous rounds where you could complete the challenge at any point throughout the weekend, the finale will only be live for the hour we give contestants to complete it.

## Location:

The live finale will be taking place at Fishburners co-working space in Sydney. It will be at there CBD space in Ultimo!
