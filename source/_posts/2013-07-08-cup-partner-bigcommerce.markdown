### With the finale for the CodeHire Cup less than a week away, we’re super excited to see what the finalists will do to impress the judges and the crowd.  I know I’ll be looking for that wow factor, mixed with a good balance of pragmatism and craftsmanship.

We’re proud to be the primary sponsor for the cup, not only because it’s a great initiative to help grow and strengthen the Startup culture here in Australia, but also because it aligns incredibly well with our culture at Bigcommerce – our quarterly hackathons alone are a testament to that!

We’ve seen explosive growth rates at Bigcommerce, meaning we’re fully equipped to attract and nurture emerging talent – and that’s why the top 3 student finalists will be offered an internship within the Engineering team.

But it doesn’t stop there, because for my teams alone we’re looking to hire in another 8 people;  and across all of Engineering, we’re talking about 20+!  

The fact is that we need to keep bringing on the best talent, because we have some really interesting problems to solve here in engineering.  Building up a brand new platform while you’re scaling out your current one, has been described to be as challenging as changing each engine on a commercial plane... while it’s still in the air!

So if you’re curious about our internships, you can check out all the details here:
