*Thanks to Bill Malkin for the hilarious (not to be taken seriously) article :)*

It was back in 2013. The competition had just begun. A hush came over the room and all you could hear was the low hum of alpha waves and the crackling of primed synapses. This was it, the battle to end all battles. Only one would emerge with the ultimate proof of their superior grey matter, of their magnificent focus and concentration, and of their obvious sacrifice and devotion to the Divine God of AbsolutelyFuckingNailingIt.

Meanwhile, I had spilt coffee on my keyboard and then couldn’t log into the network. Oh, the C and the Fin the password are upper case? Thank you. Sheesh! This was going to be a very long day for this Codehire Cup Judge. Luckily I looked absolutely magnificent in my white, XL-sized, still-too-snug, judge’s t-shirt with some Ruby crap written on the front of it. (Not that I don’t intensely admire Ruby and its weirdly wonderful devotees. It’s just that there are a few dark spots on my brain scan that I attribute to the two months I attempted to be a Ruby on Rails programmer. But please, don’t let this be about me, let this be about the Codehire Cup.)

My neck gets very sore too.

I blame PHP.

Bloody hell! Only fifteen minutes into the competition and some of the contestants have already finished! Are these people even human? I was getting incredibly nervous. They can probably even read my fricking mind! If they smell fear they will kill me. I started judging the first completed Java program. At least with Java I had God on my side.

What had we judges gotten ourselves into? Here we sit in our little room, telling stupid, immature jokes, and we were about to judge programs written by a hundred of the greatest brains in our country! These people are now, or will soon be, building a virtual world far smarter and more powerful than had ever even been dreamed of for God’s sake! I felt sick. I tried desperately to stop sculling Tic-Tacs. Damn my pathetic addiction. I tried to remember what I was doing. Yes, try and log into the network. I was in! I am so fricking awesome.


Ok now focus for God’s sake! The agonising had begun. Between cappuccinos we judges had refined and perfected our elaborate, tight, scoring algorithm and started looking for the no-nos and the yes-yeses. Hang on a minute! This particular person has done this but it’s because they’ve done that so maybe in this case it’s really a yes-yes and not a no-no. But shouldn’t they actually have done the other? I shouldn’t be judging this, I am not worthy! Screw it, it looks damn good and I like it so I give them a point. Is that acceptable, to give them a point just because I’m impressed? What if I’m required to stand up and justify that point? 

Do I just say it was because I was impressed or do I make some technical shit up? I’ll wait and see what my accuser is like first. What if they yell at me? Come on pussy, mark the next Java program and make another enemy.

Oooh, this one is nearly all yes-yeses. I wipe the drool from my chin; I give high points; I feel good. The next program is nearly all no-nos so I give low points and feel bad. I am never going to be a judge again. Oh the next program is great! What a fantastic job we’ve got!
 
 Our judge’s time is up, all programs have been marked and we’re just waiting for Dan to tally everything up in his system. But now the contestants are getting restless. What the hell’s he doing? Now he seems to be checking every damn point in the entire competition! We judges don’t care. We’ve survived the agonising. 
  
  We’ve also learnt a bit more about our respective languages but we’re admitting that to no-one. We’re now drinking coffee, eating Tic-Tacs, and telling stupid jokes again. Let’s pick on the Python judge! I hope nobody looks in the door.
