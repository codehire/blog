### Last month, while shooting in the US for the upcoming [Codr.TV](http://codr.tv) documentary, Debugging Diversity, I spent a week in Vegas and was pleasantly surprised!

Having never been to Las Vegas I had a picture in my mind of gambling, partying and debauchery and when I hit the strip with some new found friends I found that Vegas certainly lives up to its reputation. However, upon meeting some of the members of the local startup and tech scene I realised that there is another side to Vegas that I entirely didn't expect.

Over the past three years, [Zappos](http://zappos.com) CEO and Founder, [Tony Hsieh](https://twitter.com/tonyhsieh) has [invested](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-12-30/zappos-ceo-tony-hsiehs-las-vegas-startup-paradise) vast sums of money ($350m) in Las Vegas to develop the [Downtown Project](http://www.downtownproject.com/). Subsequently, the [Vegas Tech Fund](http://vegastechfund.com/) was started and is making a number of investments in local technology startups.

Initially, I didn't even realise that Downtown and the Strip were separate places but don't be fooled by the Vegas facade. There is a more depth and substance to this city than I realised.

I spent a couple of days at the [Work in Progress](http://www.workinprogress.lv/) co-working space and met the founders of several startups including [Mining Stock Valuator](https://miningstockvaluator.com/), [SkyworksAS](http://skyworksas.com/) and [CheckIO](http://www.checkio.org/). I also met with the "Unicorn Whisperer", Heather Wilde, at [ROCeteer](http://www.roceteer.com/) who seeks to find the next billion dollar company in Las vegas!

The tech scene itself is blossoming in Vegas too with regular meetings for almost every major language and even a [mini-conference](http://vegastech.com/las-vegas-ruby-mini-conference/).

Don't be surprised if Las Vegas becomes a startup hotspot over the coming years!
