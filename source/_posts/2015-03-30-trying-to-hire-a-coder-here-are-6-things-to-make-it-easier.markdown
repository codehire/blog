![Hiring](/images/hiring.jpg)


Whether you work in HR for a big company or are co-founder of a 3 person startup, hiring software coders can be a challenging task. There are generally far more positions available than there are qualified coders who happen to be looking for work. Unfortunately, this means that poaching in the industry is common and the little guys tend to struggle to fill positions.

However, there are a number of things you can do to improve your chances of success when hiring. When I was CEO at Codefire I hired dozens of engineers. We were one of the only companies in our city that would regularly receive applications from great coders and I attribute that to us having a strong “Tech Employer Brand” amongst the coder community.


## 1. Get involved in the community

In case you missed the memo, coding is actually a highly social pursuit. Whether as a beginner or a highly experienced engineer, coders love attending meet-ups and events. I’m a regular attendee of the [Sydney Ruby](http://ruby.org.au/meetups/syd.html) and [JavaScript](http://www.sydjs.com) events and have been to several of the Australian 4-day [Rails Camps](http://railscamps.com/).

Most of these events attract a large number of attendees including many people that you would probably never otherwise get a chance to meet.

Take a look at [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) or do a Google search for relevant meet-ups in your city and go along. Its good to network and mingle to meet some of the local community. Some events even have dedicated time slots to spruik your open positions but a word of caution: make sure you adhere to any guidelines or rules the group or meet-up may have. If you violate these or come on too strong you run the risk of alienating yourself and any goodwill you’ve generated will be abolished.

Its also worth trying to keep up a regular attendance with meet-ups and events, even if you don’t happen to be hiring right at that moment. Becoming a regular face in the community will make things significantly easier when the time does come to hire.

## 2. Ask for Referrals

Great coders generally know great coders. If you have some great coders in your team already, or even if some of your friends and connections are great coders, ask them if they know someone who might suit your position. When you ask, be very specific about what it is you need. This includes what technologies or projects the person would get to work on (see also, number 3).

Coders referred to your business take a little out of the guess work (but you should still interview thoroughly). Particularly, if the referral has worked with someone on your team you know what you are getting yourself into. Some of my best hires have been through referrals like this!

## 3. Build a “Tech Employer Brand”

Most businesses put lots of effort into building their brand to customers but very few think about how they brand themselves to new hires. As more and more companies that traditionally were not based on technology start to build internal technology teams this becomes ever more crucial. Take [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com) and [Uber](http://uber.com) as famous examples.

If a coder is looking for a new job they will often start with companies that they know. More particularly they will pursue companies that use technology they know or are interested in. In many cases, a coder may want a new job so that they can use a new technology that they don’t get to use in their current role. Thus, it is crucially important that you promote the kinds of tech you use, the problems you are solving and methods (e.g Agile, Scrum) you use to your hiring audience.

There are many ways you can approach this. Have one of your team do a talk at a local meet-up; start a technical blog; or make some of your software open-source.

## 4. Contribute to Open Source

If you’re not a coder yourself you might be surprised to realise how much most coders rely on open source. Look at the [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org) framework for example. It was released as an open source project in 2006, has had millions of downloads and is used by some of the web’s biggest companies. The company behind it, [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) (formerly 37signals) became known as an industry thought leader and many coders covet positions there.

Your open source strategy doesn’t have to be quite so dramatic to be effective. Releasing a useful library to Github and letting other people use it can do wonders for your Tech Employer Brand.

## 5. Hire Accelerator Grads (but use caution)

There are a growing number of intensive coding schools teaching people to code (e.g. [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/), [Hackbright Academy](http://hackbrightacademy.com/) and [The Coder Factory](http://coderfactory.com)) and these organisations regularly have graduates looking for a position.

Find an academy that teaches the languages or frameworks that you need in your business and reach out to them. Most will provide you the ability to meet the graduates and interview ones that you think will be a good fit for your business. If you can, see if you can meet them prior to graduating so that you can measure progress as they go through the course.

A word of caution, however. Remember that the graduates from an accelerator are junior and will almost certainly need guidance from a more experienced coder or engineer. If you don’t have someone else in your organisation with the time and experience to be a mentor I wouldn’t recommend this approach.

## 6. Use Tech Focussed Job Boards

A coder who is looking for work is probably doing so for one of three reasons: they are brand new to the industry (see above), they have had a break for some reason and are returning to work (say for maternity leave) or, most likely, they are just ready for a new opportunity. Pay attention to the last reason. Coders are often on the lookout for a new challenge. It can be hard to stay motivated working on the same project for a long time. That said, most coders will do a lot of research before getting to the application stage.

This is why it pays to use a technology focussed job board such as [codehire.com](http://www.codehire.com). Coders can research the companies that are hiring and the technologies they are using without having to filter through job ads for a lawyer or accountant. What’s more tech job boards tend to allow coders to search by technology specific criteria such as what language your company uses. Also, pay attention to whether the job site allows jobseekers to subscribe to email job alerts. Often this will give you the chance to get your job ad in front of a coder that may not be actively using the site.

Remember though, that advertising for positions will be significantly more effective when you have an established Tech Employer Brand. Coders will know who you are and will be more likely to apply.
