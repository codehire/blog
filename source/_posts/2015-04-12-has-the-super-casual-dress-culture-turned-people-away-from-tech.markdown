It all seemed to start in the late 70’s. Apple and Microsoft were still in their humble infancy but starting to blaze a trail that would ultimately become the Silicon Valley we know today.

However, there was another key player in that world: IBM. IBM represented everything Apple and Microsoft didn’t. Old school, big-corporate thinking. The kind of thinking that could only be done in a perfectly pressed, blue suit.

The IBM of today is actually a very progressive, forward thinking company but as the 80’s dawned, and the first inklings of tech culture emerged, engineers and tech entrepreneurs rebelled against the old ways. Technology provided a gateway to a new world where every rule was up for review.

_And with this new cultural frontier came a new expectation of dress code._

I’ll never forget my first business trip to San Francisco (I’d been before but only as a tourist). I had arranged a meeting with a prominent CTO via Twitter. He was more than willing to let me come and meet him despite us having never met (it probably helped that I was a customer of his company). In fact he even bought me lunch.

When I arrived at his office he greeted me wearing an old tee-shirt, sneakers and the daggiest shorts I’d ever seen. He was the CTO and Founder of this company, a brilliant engineer and likely worth several million at least; but the man seemed to have a complete lack of dress sense. Or at least didn't seem to care about his appearance in the slightest .

The more time I spent in SF and the Valley in general the more I noticed so many of the members of the tech scene dress down. Some, waaaay down.

Cross the country to New York, or across the Atlantic to London and you simply don’t see the kind of down-scale dress codes you see in the valley. Ok, sure there is definitely a different standard in the tech world but its not as marked as in Silicon Valley.

So here’s the thing. I love that I don’t need to get dressed up to go to work in tech. But the super relaxed dress code is a remnant of the counter culture that started in the early days of Apple (Steve Jobs was often seen in the Atari offices with no shoes for example). Tech is absolutely no longer the counter culture. It is the industry everyone gets excited about. It is a big-business-designer brand-highly-evolved industry!

Could it be that newcomers to tech might be put off by the scruffy looking, arguably under-dressed incumbents?

In many companies I’ve worked with, the idea of a business suit (and I include the kind that women wear in that sentence too) is synonymous with a sort of ignorance. Its almost as if you don’t belong to the crowd that “gets it” if you’re dressed well.

We all know tech has a talent supply problem and this means the industry has to start being more inclusive. The way people dress or are expected to dress certainly has a big impact on a company’s culture and how included a team member can feel.

I’m not saying we should go back to the old days of IBM blue pressed suits but in the spirit of diversity lets start accepting that an awesome coder can wear a Hugo Boss shirt and chinos or the latest casual skirt from Zara.
