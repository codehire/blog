> We're in uncharted waters. Demand for coders has never been higher and it's making tech recruiters to do what ever they can to secure talent for their clients. The only problem is, their tactics are pushing coders away.

_Disclaimer: In this article we talk about the general case against recruiters however not all agencies are created equal. For example, the folks over at Lookahead are well worth a look._

Here‚Äôs why coders hate recruiters:

## They Keyword Match

Most recruiters (with some notable exceptions) are not coders themselves. That may not seem like that big of a deal but the subtleties of the software world can split the difference between a perfect hire and a terrible one. Without an understanding of language idiosyncrasies recruiters often fall back to keyword matching.

Of course, there are several problems with this but the most obvious is that just because a candidate puts Java on their resume doesn‚Äôt mean that they are a good Java coder (one course in college does not a coder make!). Conversely, great coders may choose only to put their preferred or strongest languages on their resume but are probably very capable of re-skilling into a new language quickly. As a consequence the recruiter could miss out on great candidates!

## They are Secretive about the Company

This is one is my personal pet hate: Recruiters are usually very protective over the connections they make. To some extent I can understand their concern. If a recruiter were to suggest a candidate to a company or vice-versa there is nothing to stop them connecting directly and bypassing the recruitment fees. However, herein lies a stupendous problem: for companies to attract great coders they need to build a relationship with the coder community well before a coder becomes a candidate for a position.

Many experienced coders will tell you that they often receive emails from recruiters presenting an opportunity. In almost all cases the recruiter won‚Äôt disclose the company thereby leaving the coder no basis on which she or he can assess if the company is worth even looking at. Its kind of like being offered a blind date when you are already in a relationship.

Companies need to brand and sell themselves to coders and that message must come from the companies themselves. Period.

## They have Immovable contracts

When contracting coders to companies, recruiters often put in place non-solicitation clauses which state that the company cannot directly contract or hire the coder (usually for a period of up to 2 years). Imagine for a moment that a contracted coder is offering great value to the company so they decide that a full-time position made sense. A recruiter‚Äôs contract would likely prevent that relationship from being possible without an additional placement fee, or even at all. Missed opportunity.

Another scenario takes place when a great candidate is presented to a company but despite loving the coder the company decides not to proceed due to high recruiter fees. As a coder in this situation you won‚Äôt get the job and won‚Äôt be able to apply for the job directly - despite being a fantastic candidate.

## They don‚Äôt understand the culture

Culture in any team is super important and engineering teams are no exception. The problem is that the coder culture is one that can only really be understood by being a part of it and recruiters will often make shabby, transparent attempts to describe it in their pitch. Unfortunately, this usually comes across as clueless and even insulting.

## They Cannibalise a coder‚Äôs pay

Because recruiter fees are so high employers will often apportion some of the budget they have in hiring to the recruitment fees. Net result, less money for you!


## They‚Äôre not personal

Recruiters often play the numbers game which frustratingly leads to spammy, generic emails or LinkedIn messages. I‚Äôve previously received the same role opportunity from multiple different recruiters from different agencies. And once I was even offered a job at my old employer because the recruiter didn‚Äôt bother to read more than the first few words of my profile.

The following tweet is absolutely hilarious. A recruiter for Groupon tries to hire the inventor of Ruby on Rails but clearly doesn't realise who they are talking to. See [here](https://gist.github.com/dhh/1285068) for the full conversation.

## They have High fees

Of course, the most obvious reason anyone dislikes a recruiter is their high fee structure. Some recruiters will charge up to 30% of first year salary which could be almost $40k in some cases. Companies certainly do pay this but it can quickly put a kibosh on an otherwise great hire.

## Post Script: The Internal Recruiter is Awesome

Its worth mentioning internal recruiters in this discussion (i.e. the folks tasked with recruiting for just one company and who are on the payroll). Internal recruiters work with a different set of motivations to agency recruiters. Firstly, they don‚Äôt hide the company; they in fact do the opposite! Secondly, they‚Äôre not driven by placement fees and so have a much higher emphasis on getting the right hire and not just any hire.

_We at Codehire are a big fans of the internal recruiter!_
