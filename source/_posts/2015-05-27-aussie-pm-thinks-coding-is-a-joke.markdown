> Australia's Prime Minister seems to think that coding is a big waste of time. Unfortunately, this attitude is endemic in much of the conservative side of politics and only worsens the crippling skills shortage already faced by the technology sector.

![Tony Abbott](/images/abbott.jpg)

Last week, opposition leader Bill Shorten [announced](http://www.itnews.com.au/News/404041,shorten-wants-all-school-kids-to-learn-to-code.aspx) that if the Labor party should win government they would introduce coding and digital technologies training in Primary Schools as a "national priority".
With a changing workforce and jobs landscape the world is facing a skills shortage in the technology sector the likes of which we have never seen. According to code.org, in the US alone only 400,000 of the 1.5 million new technology jobs by 2020 will be filled.

Many technology companies have been struggling to find competent software programmers to supply growing demand for years, some even resorting to large cash signing bonuses just for taking a job.

While there are many factors contributing to the skills shortage, one of the major ones is commonly referred to as the pipeline problem. Put simply, there just aren't enough kids choosing STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Maths) careers when they leave school.

So it begs the question why isn't coding taught in school? We teach Languages, Science and Maths why not coding? Coding is just another skill to which everyone should be exposed.

Today in Parliament question time, Shorten asked the government if they would support Labor's plan to teach kids in school coding. This was Abbott's response:

<blockquote>Let's just understand exactly what the Leader of the Opposition has asked. He said that he wants primary school kids to be taught coding so they can get the jobs of the future. Does he want to send them all out to work at the age of 11? Is that what he wants to do? Seriously? Seriously?</blockquote>

So because I learned how to swing a softball bat at 11 I should play for the Yankees? Or because I was taught how to construct a sentence I should write a best-selling novel?

Coding is a skill. Not everyone will become a coder but by teaching it to kids at a young age they get exposed to things that most adults in 2015 have no clue about. If kids don't even know what coding is how could they ever want to choose it as a career later in life? Or how could they even incorporate it into their marketing, accounting or management job if they don't have basic skills?

The man who thinks that [social media is digital graffiti](http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/government-it/tony-abbott-dismisses-social-media-as-electronic-graffiti-again-20150126-12yg26.html) doesn't understand technology nor the importance of it to the future of the global economy. That doesn't mean that every kid shouldn't have the opportunity to learn how to survive and succeed in the not-so-distant technological future.

Only Labor has a plan for a modern, smart and fair Australia.</p>Posted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BillShorten">Bill Shorten MP</a> on Tuesday, May 26, 2015</blockquote></div></div>
