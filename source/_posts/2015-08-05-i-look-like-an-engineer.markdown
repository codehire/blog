_What does an Engineer look like? This is the question both asked and answered but an incredible twitter frenzy these past 24 hours._

## #iLookLikeAnEngineer

In case you missed it, the #iLookLikeAnEngineer hashtag on twitter has been going crazy the past day or so. It all started when Isis Wegner appeared on a job ad for OneLogin and, a number of Twitter users decided that for some reason, she wasn't representative of engineers. TechCrunch [wrote it up nicely](http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/03/ilooklikeanengineer-aims-to-spread-awareness-about-gender-diversity-in-tech/) so I won't cover it again here.

What I do want to do is call to your attention the thousands of amazing people who are showing just how dumb the engineer or coder stereotype is. In fact, we made a little app on [CODR.TV](https://codehire.com/codrtv/i-look-like-an-engineer) so you can see just how diverse this growing and thriving community is!
