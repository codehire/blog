### There are three keys to getting your first coding job: knowing how to ace whiteboard interviews, knowing how to read legacy code, and knowing the right people.


# Whiteboard Interviewing 

Most coding job interviews won't involve someone in a suit asking you questions about your "greatest weakness". Instead, they'll ask you to demonstrate your coding knowledge. 

So be ready to solve "whiteboard interview" questions. Your interviewer will describe a problem, and you'll be expected to sketch out a solution using nothing more than your wits and a whiteboard marker. 

While situations like these - where you don't have access to documentation or StackOverflow.com - rarely occur on the job, your interviewers will still expect quick solutions from you at the whiteboard. 

Fortunately, there's a book that both hiring managers and candidates read to prepare for whiteboard interviewing: [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/098478280X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=098478280X&linkCode=as2&tag=out0b4b-20&linkId=4LOZ5JGICYZJO33D). If you spend about 3 weeks working through this book, whiteboard interviews should present no problem. 


# Legacy Code 

Many job interviews will involve you pair programming with your interviewer, usually within the context of "legacy code" - code that existed before you started working on the project. 

You'll need to know which questions to ask so you can navigate around these large codebases well enough to get things done. 

Many aspiring developers spend all their time building new apps from scratch. This is a necessary part of learning to code, but you should also contribute to open source projects. By doing this, you'll get plenty of exposure to large codebases, and plenty of practice reading and understanding other people's legacy code. 


# Knowing The Right People 

When you're trying to get your first job, the last thing you should worry about is pasting your resume into web forms. 

Eighty percent of jobs aren't advertised. Instead they're filled by someone the hiring manager already knows (see this [NPR article](http://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133474431/a-successful-job-search-its-all-about-networking)). But most job seekers don't understand this. The result is intense competition for a small minority of the jobs that are actually out there. 

Don't be a resume in a stack of resumes - be that person the hiring manager knows from kickball. Be that person they watched give a lightning talk at a recent meetup. 

Spend every weekday evening at events, getting to know people. Not just the hiring managers, but also other coders who can put in a good word for you with their bosses. 

On weekends, go to conferences and hackathons. Budget as much money as possible for dinners, drinks and event tickets. 


# Focus your scarce time where it will have the most impact. 

- Work through Cracking the Code Interview 
- Contribute to open source 
- Go to events and meet people 

This will put you in the best position to get your first coding job. Happy coding!
